# Testing

##  Navigation
### User Expectation
*   As a user, I want a website that is easy and intuitively to use.
*   As a user, I want to see what the website is about at first glance.
*   As a user, I want a website that works on all screen sizes.
*   As a user, I want to be able to traverse to relevant social media.
### Intention
*   The navigation bar on the top of the screen is mostly focussed on the homepage, with a spyscroll following the user where it goes. The scrollspy also shows if the user is in the cart. The user can also find the login/registration and logout/dashboard links here. The superusers also have access to Manage Site. Also the site should be responsive to most if not all screen sizes. Lastly every user will start on the homepage in the hero section. It should be obvious where the site is about upon seeing this. And the social media links should work.
### Tests
1.  See if scrollspy works on the homepage & cart.
2.  See if login/register change to logout/dashboard upon login in and vice versa.
3.  See if non superusers can see the Manage site link. And if superuser actually can see the link.
4.  See if site is responsive.
5.  See if landing is obvious to users.
6.  Check to social media links.
### Results
1.  Scrollspy works as intended.
2.  Upon logging in the relevant links change.
3.  Non Superuser do not see the Manage Site link. Superusers do.
4.  Tested on all standard dimensions in the chrome developer tools aswell as my Sony Xperia XZ and various other smartphones in the family. It seems that that Iphone 4 in the chrome devtools has a slight problem with the info-card, as it bleeds over into the about page.

5.  Landing is obvious. Name, profesion, socialmedia links and call to action are all present.

6.  Social media links, link to appropriate sites, in a new tab.
### Conclusion
*   All tests passed.
### Bugs
*   None.
### Comments
*   The Iphone 4 size problem has been noted, but as it is an old phone and it does not hamper functionality that much; it will be left as is.
